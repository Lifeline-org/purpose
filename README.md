# LifeLine's Purpose

 
* A *Public Facing* search engine, and publication system for abuse, while
  avoiding malicious reports.

## Particularly

- To give people an opportunity to report malicious, dangerous, or otherwise sour
  behavior to the public, in relation to a location, without needing to trust the police.
  - to rate said reports, and their reporters, to establish a form of opinionated
    consensus; if you disagree with the reports, you are free to form your own personalized
    ratings of reporters.
- To observe reported malicious events as a map;
  - again, with a scaling trust model for reporters
  - and obvious filtration methods for various subsets of issues

- to give an opportunity for those who are human trafficed to report their circumstace
  with faith that their reporting will not put them in harm, while also avoiding abuse
  of the system from anonymous assailants.
 
* It should be distributed and freely implementable:
  - someone should be capable of hosting their own, private / local instance
  - ideally, instances should communicate consensus ala cryptographically signed protos:
    TODO
 
 
## Types of Issues

- extensibly discrete: easy to implement
- any. Stringly typed, with search methods 

### Assasilant Identification

- ala demographic
- featuring more precise information if necessary

### Victim Identification
